# Placement-Management-System
 The "Placement Management System" is a comprehensive web-based
application designed to streamline and enhance the processes involved in
student placement and company recruitment. This system provides a userfriendly interface for students and companies, facilitating efficient
communication and information exchange during the placement process. For students, the system allows seamless registration, enabling them to input
personal details, academic information, and professional aspirations. Students
can apply to various job opportunities posted by companies, submit their
resumes, and track the status of their applications. The system also supports
file uploads for documents such as CVs and cover letters. Companies benefit from a dedicated portal where they can post job openings, review student applications, and manage the recruitment workflow. The
system offers a centralized database of student profiles, making it easier for
companies to identify potential candidates based on specific criteria. Administrators have access to comprehensive dashboards providing insights
into overall system activity. They can manage user roles, oversee the
application process, and extract valuable analytics to enhance decision- making. Key features include secure user authentication, a responsive and intuitive
user interface, and integration with a relational database for efficient data
management. The system is built using web technologies such as PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a back-end supported by a relational database
management system (RDBMS). The Placement Management System aims to improve the efficiency, transparency, and accessibility of the placement process for both students and
companies, ultimately contributing to the success of students in securing
relevant employment opportunities and meeting the talent acquisition needs of
recruiting companies.
